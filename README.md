# Budget Tracker

This is a personal project created with the objective of learning how to create an app with react-native.

# Features

Note: The features focus on learning new things, so polishing the features was not a priority

- a sqlite database stored on the user's phone, created with expo
- the ability to add new expenses in the main menu, with each expenses having a category, price, date and optional description
- a slideable menu where new categories can be added
- a navigating through the added expenses, categoriesd by the month they were added
- collapsing all expenses on a day/based on category (can be change with the "Sort" button)
- seeing a pie chart with the expenses based on categories
